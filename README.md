## Dataset Selection 
- As explained in the data model, popularity is quantified by the ‚ÄúScore‚Äù given to each reaction type.
- We therefore need data showing the content ID, category, content type, reaction type, and reaction score.
  These parameters we will get through below tables -
  - ReactionTypes
  - Reaction
  - Content
- So, to figure out popularity, we‚Äôll have to add up which content categories have the largest score.

## Data Cleaning
- In data cleaning process, I removed unnecessary columns.
- Removed rows that had values which were missing.
- Changed data types of some values within a column

**End result is three cleaned data sets.**

## Data Modelling
Created a final data set by merging three tables in PowerBI Power Query Editor
